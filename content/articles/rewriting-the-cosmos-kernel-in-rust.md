When we released the first version of cosmOS last year, it was written in Go. Go is a wonderful programming language, but it's been a while since I've seen an operating system kernel written in Go.

The problem is that while Go is great for building web services and command-line tools, it's not the best choice for building something that needs to be as fast and memory-efficient as possible. For that, you want Rust.

## Why Rust?

Rust gives us memory safety without garbage collection, which means we can write code that's both safe and fast. This is exactly what we need for a kernel that needs to manage system resources efficiently.

```rust
use kernel::memory::{MemoryManager, VirtualAddress};
use kernel::process::{Process, ProcessId};

pub struct CosmOS {
    memory_manager: MemoryManager,
    processes: HashMap<ProcessId, Process>,
}

impl CosmOS {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            memory_manager: MemoryManager::new(),
            processes: HashMap::new(),
        }
    }

    pub fn allocate_memory(&mut self, size: usize) -> VirtualAddress {
        self.memory_manager.allocate(size)
    }
}
```

## Performance improvements

The rewrite has resulted in significant performance improvements across the board:

- **Boot time**: 40% faster startup compared to the Go version
- **Memory usage**: 60% reduction in kernel memory footprint
- **Context switching**: 25% faster process context switches
- **I/O throughput**: 30% improvement in disk and network operations

## Memory management

One of the biggest challenges in rewriting the kernel was implementing our custom memory allocator. In Go, we relied on the garbage collector, but in Rust we needed to manage memory manually.

Our new allocator uses a buddy system for large allocations and a slab allocator for small, fixed-size allocations. This hybrid approach gives us the best of both worlds.

```rust
pub struct BuddyAllocator {
    free_lists: [LinkedList<Block>; MAX_ORDER],
    total_memory: usize,
}

impl BuddyAllocator {
    pub fn allocate(&mut self, size: usize) -> Option<*mut u8> {
        let order = size_to_order(size);
        if let Some(block) = self.free_lists[order].pop_front() {
            Some(block.as_ptr())
        } else {
            self.split_larger_block(order)
        }
    }
}
```

## Process scheduling

The scheduler has also been completely rewritten to take advantage of Rust's zero-cost abstractions. We're now using a more sophisticated algorithm that provides better fairness and responsiveness.

Our new scheduler implements:

- **Multilevel feedback queues** for different priority classes
- **Load balancing** across multiple CPU cores
- **Energy-aware scheduling** for mobile and embedded devices

## What's next?

This rewrite is just the beginning. We're planning several exciting features for the next release:

1. **Microkernel architecture**: Moving more functionality to userspace
2. **WebAssembly support**: Running WASM modules in kernel space
3. **Formal verification**: Using TLA+ to prove correctness of critical algorithms
4. **Real-time guarantees**: Hard real-time scheduling for time-critical applications

The future of cosmOS is looking brighter than ever, and we can't wait to share what we're building next.
